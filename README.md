##  About Me

Hi, I'm **Ramiz Al-Afif**, a junior developer interested in learning and developing programming skills, especially in the field of **web development**. My passion is building interactive and useful application projects that help people learn and improve their skills.

I participated in the **CodeSprout 2025 Beginner's Edition Hackathon** by developing **WebCheck**, a project aimed at helping beginners learn HTML in a fun and interactive way. 

During my participation in this hackathon, I learned a lot about how to build applications from scratch using HTML and JavaScript. I've also always been looking for opportunities to improve my programming skills.

I look forward to more opportunities to develop my skills and contribute to open source projects.
